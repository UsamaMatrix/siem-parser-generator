## 🔍 Overview

The **Enterprise SIEM Parser Generator** automates the creation of **custom parsers for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems**, streamlining the process of **onboarding new log sources and enhancing threat detection capabilities.**  
This tool empowers SOC teams to parse logs from **new devices, cloud platforms, and applications**, without waiting for vendor-specific updates.

Built for **enterprise SOC environments**, the framework boosts detection capabilities and reduces the time to integrate new technologies.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Log Pattern Detection:** Uses regex and ML to identify fields in new log sources.
- ⚙️ **SIEM Parser Generation:** Supports formats for Splunk, IBM QRadar, Elastic Stack, and others.
- 🚀 **Rapid Deployment:** Generates deployable parser configurations in seconds.
- 🛡️ **Custom Enrichment:** Adds geo-IP, user attribution, and severity mapping.
- 📊 **Validation Module:** Tests generated parsers against live or sample log streams.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Regex / PyParsing
- YAML / JSON parser configuration templates
- ML algorithms for pattern detection (optional)
- Supported SIEMs: Splunk, QRadar, Elastic Stack, Graylog

## 🚫 Why Code is Confidential?

The parser generation algorithms and SIEM integrations are **enterprise-grade automation scripts** that could be misused to manipulate or disrupt SOC environments.  
Access is restricted to security teams and SOC engineers.
